# Changelog

All notable public changes to TropaTT should be documented here.

This project follows a lightweight Keep a Changelog style. Dates are added when a release is actually created.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Security: Environment capabilities endpoint (`/api/v1/health/deep` → `environment` section) with server detection, storage location check, extension availability, and installation warnings.
- Security: Storage protection — uploaded files stored as `.bin` on disk, dangerous extensions (`.php`, `.phtml`, `.phar`, etc.) rejected with `FILE_TYPE_FORBIDDEN`, upload quarantine with forced `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
- Security: SSRF protection — DNS-based URL validation with private IP blocking, IP pinning via `CURLOPT_RESOLVE` for webhooks and module downloads.
- Security: MCP permission registry — 548 tools registered with explicit permissions, fail-closed for unregistered tools.
- Security: REST route authorization — 52 self-service routes explicitly annotated (`authz_note`), contract test for mutating route authorization.
- Security: Trusted proxy support — configurable `CRM_TRUSTED_PROXIES`, `clientIp()` vs `remoteAddr()` separation, CIDR-based matching.
- Security: Conditional HSTS — configurable via env, `includeSubDomains` off by default, not sent over HTTP.
- Security: CSP — `style-src` without `'unsafe-inline'`, nonce-based for `<style>` blocks, `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` for legacy compatibility.
- Security: install/status returns 404 after installation (prevents product fingerprinting).
- Security: PathGuard — handles directory entries in update packages (fixes update mechanism).
- Security: Composite 2FA rate limiting key (IP + login token) prevents cross-user DoS behind shared proxies.
- Security: Storage self-check in health endpoint — verifies that upload storage is not web-accessible.
- Public repository maintenance files: security policy, contribution guide, roadmap, support guide, issue templates, and pull request template.
- Time tracking analytics dashboard with per-user time and earnings reports.
- Worklog summary API (`GET /api/v1/worklogs/summary`, `earnings`, `matrix`, `detail` endpoints).
- Per-user hourly rates (`cost_rate`, `bill_rate`) set by admin in user profile.
- Admin tags page with CRUD, description, and usage count.
- Tags in task list/board API response (via `JSON_ARRAYAGG` subquery).
- Kanban tag filter and tag chips on cards.
- Clickable tag chips → filtered task list.
- Workflow trigger conditions by task tag.
- Searchable selects (`makeSelectSearchable()`) for all user, project, client, and tag selects.
- Reset button on time analytics filter toolbars.
- Day-of-week labels on analytics date columns.
- Weekend row highlighting on all analytics tables.
- Column hover with intersection cell emphasis.
- Editable team names → open edit modal.
- Notification badge in sidebar nav (collapsed mode).
- Clients: «Create task» / «Create project» action buttons on the client detail page — they open the global create modals with the current client pre-filled.
- Clients: hybrid contact role field — a select with free-text entry; roles not present in the preset list are stored and displayed as plain text.
- Projects: admin statuses page now shows two independent tables — task statuses and project statuses (split by scope).
- Projects: the project workflow edit form loads statuses from the admin dictionary, so «Планирование»/«Активный» and any custom project statuses are available as transitions.
- Projects: completing a project that still has open tasks is blocked with a choice modal — «Close all tasks» (paged bulk close) or «Move to another project» (paged per-task reassignment); `open_task_count` is returned in the `PROJECT_HAS_OPEN_TASKS` error meta.
- UI: user-selectable color themes — dark and high-contrast (low-vision) schemes in addition to the default light theme; per-user choice on the profile page and a quick switcher in the topbar, applied instantly without flash and persisted across devices (profile preferences).

### Changed

- Security: dashboard widget permissions are now server-authoritative — the client widget loader trusts the permission-filtered `active` list from `GET /api/v1/dashboard/widgets` instead of duplicating permission checks in JavaScript (single source of truth; catalog and active widgets are filtered fail-closed server-side).
- Security: `system_health` dashboard widget is now gated behind `settings.manage` (the `/api/v1/health/status` endpoint stays auth-only for liveness checks).
- Security: active sessions listing (`GET /api/v1/security/sessions`) no longer requires `logs.view` — it is a self-service endpoint scoped to the actor's own sessions.
- Security: worklog visibility model unified across widgets — `AnalyticsService::visibleUserIds()` now includes the user hierarchy (`descendantIds()`), matching `WorklogService::getVisibleUserIds()`.
- README positioning expanded to describe TropaTT as CRM, task manager, task tracker, project platform, AI-assisted workspace, and self-hosted work system.
- Update smoke-test marker for verifying update-center delivery without direct demo deploy.
- SHARED_HOSTING_GUIDE.md — added sections on storage protection, trusted proxies, HSTS, nginx configuration.
- Updates now run as a resumable step machine so they work on any shared/virtual hosting: file backup, file apply, DB dump, migrations, DB restore and file rollback are split into many short HTTP requests (configurable `steps` budgets in `api/config/update.php`, ~20s per request by default) instead of one long request that shared hosts cut at the proxy/PHP-FPM timeout. The lock uses a heartbeat across steps, apply/rollback tokens support multi-step continuation with a sliding expiry, package download streams to disk, and the admin-updates page drives the step loop with progress display.
- Installer: the post-install «update available» notice now queries the update-center `update-plan` (build comparison from `current_build=0`) instead of a semver comparison that could never fire because every build ships the same VERSION — fresh installs now see the hint to update when a newer build is published.

### Fixed

- Security: IDOR in the batch milestones endpoint (`GET /api/v1/milestones?project_public_ids=...`) — `MilestoneService::listByProjectIds()` now performs object-level authorization via `ProjectService::get()` for every project and drops inaccessible ones (fail-closed); the batch size is capped at 100 to prevent authorization-query amplification.
- Security: worklog matrix response (`GET /api/v1/worklogs/matrix`) leaked org-wide team/project names — the `teams`/`projects` option lists are now scoped to the actor's accessible teams and projects (same visibility rule as the analytics breakdown).
- Security: `WorklogRepository::listTeams()` leaked the full team list when a non-root user had no accessible teams — an empty access list now means "no teams" (fail-closed) instead of falling through to "all teams"; `listTeams()` takes an explicit `$actorIsRoot` flag like `listProjects()`.
- Database: schema creation on SQLite used MySQL-only `UNIQUE KEY` table constraints, which failed with `near "KEY": syntax error` when the updater applied a pending `InitialSchemaMigration` on a SQLite install. Constraints now use the portable `CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE (...)` form (verified on MySQL 9.6 and SQLite).
- Updates: added an end-to-end step-machine test with a real pending migration (`InitialSchemaMigration`) — asserts a real DB snapshot is taken, the migration is applied across step requests, and rollback restores the database to its pre-migration state.
- i18n: the admin-updates (Updates) page is now fully translated into German, Spanish, French, Brazilian Portuguese and Chinese — all 7 locales are complete for the updates section.
- Clients: the «Compact view» toggle active state is readable again (solid background + white text instead of green-on-green); added missing `clients.normal_view`/`compact_view` keys to the Russian locale.
- i18n: added missing EN keys for contact roles and project statuses (i18n key parity test).
